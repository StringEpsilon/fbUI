Features:

[ ] More basic elements for a first release:
	[X] Radio buttons
	[X] Labels
	[-] Listbox 
	[X] Scrollbars 
	[ ] Textarea / Multiline textbox
	[ ] Dropdown / Combobox
	[ ] ...
	
[ ] uiTextbox / Textcontrols:
	[X] Selection of text
	[X] Handling of CRTL+A
	[ ] Copy & Paste

[X] Handling of OnMouseMove. Important for scrollbars and stuff.

[ ] Write a readme and proper example code.

In the future:	

[ ] Implement a mechanism to move elements around

[ ] Inactive elements
	[ ] Ignored in event-handling.
	[ ] Different rendering...?
	
[ ] Write API-documentation, once it's stable enough.
	
Internal / Performance / style:

[ ] Add layers! Background, active, floating. That should be enough to make overlapping sub-elements work (menues, comboboxes, ...)

[ ] Better strategy for routing click-events. Right now, it'is terrible for overlapping elements
	For example: Clicking on a dropdown that overlaps with a button would trigger both.
	I think I might need a z-Index and a way to check that stuff fast.


[ ] Better event-handling in general. By just making threads, it can happen that events reach the uiElement in the wrong order
	or worse: The threads queue up because of mutexing-issues.
	(Doesn't help that the GFXlib occasionally has deadlocks without a global gfx-mutex)
	Ideas:
		* Event-buffer with multiple workers
		* Handle mousemove (main source of event-threads) differently

[ ] Graphics overhaul: Prettier code, new constants.
	[ ] Introduce properly named constants instead
		Alternative: Color and TextColor could be properties on uiElement with decent-looking defaults

BUGS:

A LOT.
