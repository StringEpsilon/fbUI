## Style

Just a couple of simple rules:

1) Use tabs for indention.

2) No prefixes for variables, except \_.

3) Use \_ for private variables of a class.

4) Use "this." for all member accesses in a class.

5) Avoid abbreviations and single-letter names.

6) Use parenthesis on function calls and IFs, where possible.
