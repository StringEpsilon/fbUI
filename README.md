# fbUI

Object Oriented UI toolkit written in FreeBASIC.

### Thanks to:

Muttonhead, for the inspiration to do this and the code I borrowed in the early stages. Check out his project 'sGUI'!

The german and international freebasic communities for helping me out.

Special thanks to DKL for fixing a couple of FreeBASIC bugs I found.
